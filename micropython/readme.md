# Micropython code for pycom LoPy with attached CoZIR CO2, Humidity and Temperature sensor

To use this code you need:
- a LoPy board, expansion board, CoZIR-AH sensor, attached LoRa antenna (make sure: no antenna = fried LoRa chip)
- the pymakr plugin (for Atom or other editor)

Update the LoPy firmware before you start (consult pycom.io for the latest updater program)

The hardware setup to connect the CO2 sensor is in ../hardware

Code to use an alternative, cheaper DHT11 sensor is in the instruction folder.
