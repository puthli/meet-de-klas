# Micropython code for pycom LoPy with attached DHT11 Humidity and Temperature sensor
Useful for instructing teachers and students without the risk of damaging an expensive CO2 sensor.

To use this code you need:
- a LoPy board, expansion board, DHT11 sensor, attached LoRa antenna (make sure: no antenna = fried LoRa chip)
- the pymakr plugin (for Atom or other editor)

Update the LoPy firmware before you start (consult pycom.io for the latest updater program)

The hardware setup to connect the DHT11 sensor is in ../hardware
