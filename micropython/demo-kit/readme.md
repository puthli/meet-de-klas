# Micropython code for pycom LoPy with attached DHT11 Humidity and Temperature sensor
Useful for instructing teachers and students without the risk of damaging more expensive sensors.

To use this code you need:
- a LoPy board, expansion board, DHT11 sensor, attached LoRa antenna (make sure: no antenna = fried LoRa chip)
- the pymakr plugin (for Atom or other editor)

For now, do NOT update the LoPy firmware before you start. The DHT11 driver will fail if you update the firmware.

The hardware setup to connect the DHT11 sensor is in ../hardware
